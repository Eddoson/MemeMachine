# MemeMachine
A Discord chat bot for all meme related activities

To setup:
  1. You'll need a config.json file with your token inside. Keep it on your .gitignore for obvious reasons. Tokens are secret. Keep this        file in ./config/config.json
  2. npm install --save discord.js

Then write some code!
